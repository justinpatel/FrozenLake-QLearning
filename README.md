# FrozenLake-QLearning
## Creating a Q table for a frozen-lake problem using Reinforcement Learning

> Used gym toolkit from openai

5 Important things for Reinforcement Learning:
1. Environment
2. Agent
3. States
4. Action
5. Reward

Environment of FrozenLake problem:
SFFF
FHFH
FFFH
HFFG

- S stands for Starting position, safe
- F stands for frozen lake which is walkable, safe
- H stands for Hole in frozen lake, fail
- G stands for Goal

> The Agent will explore the different ways to reach the goal and is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal. 

This is the equation to feed values in Qtable:     
`Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + LEARNING_RATE * (reward + GAMMA * np.max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])`

> Qtable contains the transitional values of between states and action.
